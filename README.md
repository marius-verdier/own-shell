## My own shell

This little project was made to pick up to the basics of C language. I only implemented basic unix commands, but we can imagine implement non existing commands.

## How to use it..

You just have to run the `main` executable, you'll enter in my shell and you'll be able to have fun :)!

Feel free to suggest new commands and new functionalities.

Have fun!
